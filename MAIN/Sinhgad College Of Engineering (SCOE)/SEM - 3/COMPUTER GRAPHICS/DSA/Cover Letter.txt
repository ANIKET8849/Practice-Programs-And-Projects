Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineering Internship position at Google, as advertised. With a strong academic foundation in Computer Engineering and hands-on experience in full-stack development, I am eager to contribute to Google's innovative environment.

Currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Engineering at Sinhgad College of Engineering, I have consistently applied my skills in Java, JavaScript, and C++ across various projects.

My academic journey, underscored by an 85.03% score in my Diploma in Computer Engineering, reflects my commitment to excellence. I have also enriched my technical acumen with coursework in Fullstack Development (Java), complemented by proficiency in Unix/Linux environments, data structures, and algorithms.

Highlighted projects such as the Restaurant Food Ordering System and ATM Simulator showcase my capability to deliver user-centric solutions, employing technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. Additionally, I have explored advanced concepts through the development of an Integrated Chatbot using Python and ChatGPT API, emphasizing my passion for innovative technologies.

Beyond technical skills, my involvement in open-source projects and leadership roles demonstrates my proactive approach and ability to drive impactful initiatives. I thrive in collaborative settings, leveraging agile methodologies and Git/GitHub for efficient project management and version control.
