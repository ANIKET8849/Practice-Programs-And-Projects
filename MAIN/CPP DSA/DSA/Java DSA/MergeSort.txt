Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how merge sort works:

Divide: Divide the list or array recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.
Conquer: Each subarray is sorted individually using the merge sort algorithm.
Merge: The sorted subarrays are merged back together in sorted order. The process continues until all elements from both subarrays have been merged.


*******The basic steps of a d&c algorithm can be boiled down to these three steps: ******

1.  Divide and break up the problem into the smallest possible “subproblem”, of the exact same type.

2.  Conquer and tackle the smallest subproblems first. Once you’ve figured out a solution that works, use that exact same technique to solve the larger subproblems — in other words, solve the subproblems recursively.

3. Combine the answers and build up the smaller subproblems until you finally end up applying the same solution to the larger, more complicated problem that you started off with!
