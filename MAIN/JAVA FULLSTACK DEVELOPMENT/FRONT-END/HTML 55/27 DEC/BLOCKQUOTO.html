            Inspired by the pioneering design of the successful Vitpilen and Svartpilen models,<br>
             the brand offers a tantalising vision of what its future move into electric urban mobility<br>
              will look like with the E-Pilen Concept.<br>

            With a power output of 8 kW and a range of 100 km the E-Pilen Concept has clearly been developed<br>
             with the urban commuter and leisure rider in mind, with a range that maximises the time between<br>
              battery charges.<br>
            
            Husqvarna Motorcycles keeps an open approach to all battery opportunities, aiding the parallel advantage<br>
             of both fixed and swappable solutions. The E-Pilen Concept features a modular and swappable battery system<br>
              allowing the power pack to be exchanged, extending the appeal and utility of electric motorcycles to those<br>
               considering the switch.
